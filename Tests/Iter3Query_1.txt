Select v such that Uses(a, v) such that Parent(i, a)

5000
2 - variables in LHS of assignments that are in while loops
assign a; while w; variable v; 
Select v such that Modifies(a, v) such that Parent*(w, a)

5000
3 - assignments that are in if loops and are directly in a if loop with "z" in RHS
assign a; if i;

5000
4 - ifs that are while loops, which has an assignment value with expression "D+E"
assign a; if i; variable v; while w;

5000
7 - return procedures that calls "main2" and has "abc" in LHS of assignments
procedure p; if i;
Select p such that Calls*(p, "main2") such that Modifies(p,"abc")

5000
8 - returns an assignment in a procedure that calls main2 and uses variabble "x" that are in if loops
procedure p; if i; assign a;
Select a such that Calls(p, "main2") such that Uses(p,"z") such that Parent(i,a)

5000
9 - returns while and assignments that are in while loops, which modifies a variable with pattern "xyz + 123" in RHS
while w; assign a; variable v;
Select <w,a> such that Parent*(w,a) such that Modifies(a,v) pattern a (_, _"xyz + 123"_)

5000
10 - returns variable that is modified in a while loop with RHS pattern _"x+1"_

5000
11 - return ifs that have an assignment value in a while loop with "z-20" in RHS

5000
12 - return assignments and values that are in while loops with "E" in LHS
variable v; assign a; while w;
Select <a,v> such that Modifies(a, v) such that Parent*(w, a) pattern a ("E",_)

5000
13 - returns while loops with an assignment with "1" in RHS that is in a while loop
assign a; while w;
Select w pattern a (_,_"1"_) such that Uses(w, a) such that Parent* (w, a)
